# Natural Language

## Natural Language Processing

Initially, we could only communicate with computers through coded instructions. Then came GUI which made computers accessible to a large part of the population. However, as time is passing, life is going faster and there is a need for a more efficient and convenient way to interact with computers. Here comes in NLP.\
Natural Language Processing is the part of AI that deals in helping computers understand natural human speech. It is not only used for speech recognition but also for **sentiment analysis**. Sentiment analysis can be used to analyse the sentiments of a piece of text. For example, tweets regarding a certain topic can be extracted and analysed to figure out the sentiments of general population towards that topic.

## Natural Language Understanding

It is used to actually understand the meaning and context of the speech/text. A lot of different blocks of speech/text can have the exact same meaning.  They can have different semantics, syntax and sentiment. NLU can help identify the exact meaning of the text.

## Natural Language Generation

After the computer has processed the text and understood it, it might need to reply back to the user with something. However, computer cannot reply with its own language (machine code) because that is not understood by human being. Hence, computers need to speak in natural language too. Here is where NLG come in.\
Based on some input, computer can generate some meaningful text. For example, when writing emails, you might have noticed that some pretty accurate suggestions are given. This is done using NLG. It looks at the previous words and suggested the most suited next word.
