# What is Data Science? 🔬
Data Science is the field of study which aims to extract insights and useful information from raw data. This information can be used in several ways; make better decisions, predict future data points, discover patterns, and much more.
Data Science helps answer a lot of our daily questions, be it finding the fastest route to our destinations or giving movie recommendations. It does this by analyzing existing data and modeling it using a certain algorithm. For example, past weather data can be fed to a model, and it can accurately predict the weather of the next few days to a certain degree of accuracy.

# Data 💽
Data can be classified into two classes: structured and unstructured. **Structured data** refers to organized information, for example sale records. This data has clearly defined rows and entries. **Unstructured data** refers to data such as images, videos, or web scrapes. This type of data does not have well-defined features.

# Machine Learning (vs Deep Learning) ⚙️🦾
In traditional programming algorithms, computers are provided with inputs and rules, and are expected to provide results. An add function would be explicitly told to add two or more numbers and return the results. However, machine learning algorithms are fed with inputs with their corresponding outputs, and they can generate the rules by themselves. These rules can be used later to evaluate results for other inputs. It should be noted that machine learning algorithms cannot be always 100% accurate, unlike traditional algorithms.
**Machine Learning** models such as those provided by scikit-learn (a python library) work best on structured data. They can be used to model the data, get statistical analysis, and predict future/unknown data points. Machine Learning models should not be confused with deep learning models. **Deep Learning** models, like the ones that can be built using TensorFlow or PyTorch (python libraries), use layers of something called artificial neurons. These work better with unstructured data.

# Data Scientist 🕵️‍♂️
A data scientist's duties include:
* 📮Data Gathering: Data can be spread over different sources, so we must gather and combine it.
*	🧼Data Cleaning: Some of the data could be inaccurate or have missing values. If these data points are not cleaned out, they can lead to inaccuracies in the model.
*	📊Data Analysis: Data must be analyzed to get some basic insights such as the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of entries. This can help us choose the best model for our data.
*	🤔Model Selection: The best model for the specific problem must be selected to provide the most accurate insights. For example, a regression model cannot be used for classification tasks and vice versa.
*	🧪Data Transformation: Data can not be fed directly into the models. Some algorithms only except numerical values and our data could be textual. Hence, this data must be transformed into a format which is acceptable for the model.
*	🔍Data Modeling: Finally, the data is then fed into the model. The model then analyzes the data and can give insights or predict labels for unlabeled data points.
*	💬Communicating Results: At last, the data scientist must communicate their findings to the relevant party in a way which is easy to understand.
