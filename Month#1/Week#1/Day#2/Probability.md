# Probability 🎲
Probability refers to the measure of chance of some event to occur. For example, when tossing a coin, probability to land heads would be 0.5 and probability to land tails would be 0.5. Both add up to 1 which isn’t a coincidence since all probabilities in any certain scenario add up to 1.
To calculate probability of a favorable event (A),
$$P(A)=\frac{no.&thinsp;of&thinsp;ways&thinsp;A&thinsp;can&thinsp;occur}{no.&thinsp;of&thinsp;all&thinsp;possibilities}$$

# Mutually and Non-mutually Exclusive Events 🏎️
Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot take place together. For example, you cannot take a left turn and right turn together. It must be separate events. Similarly, you can’t win a game and lose a game together. It must be one or the other.
Non-mutually exclusive events are those that may take place together or not. For example, you can be driving and listening to the radio together or you can be doing these separately.

# Independent and Dependent Events 🧨
Independent events are events that do not affect each other’s probability to occur. For example, eating a sandwich for lunch does not affect the probability of buying a car, or flying on a plane does not affect the probability of drinking tea.
Dependent events are events which do affect each other’s probabilities. For example, owning a dog affects the probability of buying dog food, or driving affects the probability of getting into an accident.

To calculate probability of two independent events occurring together,
$$P(A&thinsp;and&thinsp;B)=P(A)×P(B)$$

To calculate probability of two dependent events occurring together,
$$P(A&thinsp;and&thinsp;B)=P(A)×P(B|A)$$
where, $P(B|A)$ refers to probability of $B$ after $A$. These are also called `conditional probability`.
