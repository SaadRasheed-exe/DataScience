# Python 🐍
Python is high-level programming language generally used for data analysis, automation and AI related tasks. 

# Basic Syntax 🔏
Python uses indentation to define scope and is dynamically typed, i.e a variable can take multiple datatypes over its lifetime.

# Data Types
Python's built-in data types include:
* Integers: whole numbers
* Floats: decimal numbers
* Strings: alphanumeric and symbolic characters encoded using Unicode.
* Boolean: True or False

# Data Structures
Python has a bunch of data structures built-in.
* Lists: a simple ordered array. It can store mutable, duplicate or same, and different type of data. Syntax: `[1, 'a', 2, 3.5, 'hello']`
* Tuples: is exactly the same as lists but is unmutable, i.e values cannot be changed once written. Syntax: `(1, 'a', 2, 3.5, 'hello')`
* Sets: list of items that are unmutable, unique and unordered. Syntax: `{1, 'a', 2, 3.5, 'hello'}`
