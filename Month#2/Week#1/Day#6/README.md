# Image Converter 🖼️🔁

Run the `imageConverter.py` script on the terminal like such:
```
python imageConverter.py infile outfile
```
1. The script can only convert jpg files to png files and vice versa.
2. `infile` is the path to input file along with its extension.
3. `outfile` is the path to output file along with desired extension.
